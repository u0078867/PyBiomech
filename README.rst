A minimal Python environment with *setuptools* library is expected. We recommend *Anaconda* 64-bit.

Installation (for Anaconda)
---------------------------

* Proceed with the installation of *PyBiomech*:

  .. code-block:: sh

     pip install PyBiomech -vvv

* To verify than everything went ok, type:

  .. code-block:: sh

     python

  and then import the library:

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> import PyBiomech

  If no error occurs, then you have correctly installed it!
